Trying to create a responsive card design for FOW card design assignment.

You can try and change the window size and the design will adapt.

Initially wanted to make "wok" as the product but while styling using a pastel pallete from coolers, I decided that the product should be something else and went with a snake plant!

#Notes for future - 
  - Although the layout is responsive, the card size may still be too big for small screens.
  - The styling is a mess, I will try to organize my styles and use responsive values like ems and rems next time.
  - Learned about a new CSS property! background-blend-mode
